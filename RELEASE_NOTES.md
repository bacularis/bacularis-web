This is a new feature and bug fix release. We added full support for all
new Bacula 15.0 config directives. Apart from that we added to deploy API
host window a connection test button to check if connection parameters are
valid before starting deploy process. At the end we fixed bugs reported by
the Community.

Changes:
 - Add new Bacula 15.0 directives support
 - Add connection test button to deploy API host function
 - Add SyncOnClose device directive support
 - Fix deploying Bacularis using ssh key without passphrase together with sudo option
 - Fix displaying API host list on Firefox
