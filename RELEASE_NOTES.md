We are pleased to announce the release of **Bacularis 5.8.0**.
This version introduces **improved accuracy** for running job byte and file
estimations. Users can now choose between quick estimations (default) or
more precise data gathered directly from the Bacula client. This feature
was inspired by an idea from Community user Rui.

This release also focuses on **language support**: Spanish, German, Italian,
and Polish translations have been updated.

Additionally, this version includes **several bug fixes**.
Community contributor MmAaXx500 provided a fix for OIDC single sign-on
compatibility issues affecting certain identity providers (e.g. Nextcloud).
We have also corrected an issue related to the SSL certificate creation form.

Finally, Bacularis has been prepared to support the new **openSUSE 16.0**
release.

We wish you smooth installations and upgrades!
