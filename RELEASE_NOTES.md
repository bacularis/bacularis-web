This is a new feature release. We introduced two significant changes:
the API host groups and easier to configure Bacula resource access.
We hope that these two new functions will much improve the user and
resource management in Bacularis.

Changes:
 - New API host groups feature
 - New much easier way of setting access to selected Bacula resources
   per API host, per API host group and per user
